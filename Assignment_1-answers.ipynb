    "Ans: In the Python programming language, an expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a result that can be used in various ways, such as assigning to a variable, passing to a function, or using in a conditional statement. Expressions are the building blocks of Python programs and are used to perform computations, manipulate data and make decisions. \n",

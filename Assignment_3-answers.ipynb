    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: When a function is defined, it simply sets up the instructions for what should happen when the function is called. The actual execution of those instructions occurs only when the function is invoked/called elsewhere in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The def statement defines/creates a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A function, which is typically defined with a name, parameters (optional) and a body containing a block of code, perfomrs a specific task. \n",
    "On the other hand, a function call is the act of executing a function to perform its task.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In a Python program, there is one global scope and Local scopes are created whenever a function is called."

    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: When a function returns, the local scope is destroyed, and all the variables in it are forgotten.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The concept of a return value pertains to functions in programming. When a function is called, it may perform some computation and optionally returns a value back to the caller. This returned value can then be used by the caller in further computations, assignments, or any other necessary tasks. In the below example, the add() function takes two arguments- a and b, adds them together and returns the result. The returned value (a + b) is then assigned to the variable result and printed."
